Adds more colours to the marker menu for all your planning needs. The mod defines all standard colours that are in CfgMarkerColors by default, but redefines the standard ingame colours to push them to the bottom of the marker colour menu. The redefined vanilla colours can be referenced by `ColorVanillaNAME`, for example `ColorVanillaRed`. Note that `ColorRed` and all standard colours are still defined!
UMMC colours can be referenced by `ColorUMMCNAME`, for example `ColorUMMCGreenLime`.

Colours added:
